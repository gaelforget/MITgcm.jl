# Summary 

General circulation models are used to study climate, ocean and atmosphere dynamics, biogechemistry, ecology, and more. The `MITgcm`, written in `Fortran`, is one of the most widely-used models of this class. We present `MITgcm.jl`, a two-way interface to `MITgcm` written in Julia that can be used to not only analyze model results but also drive model simulations. With `MITgcm.jl` users can setup, build, and launch `MITgcm` without having to know shell scripting or having to edit text files manually. `MITgcm.jl` provides support in `Julia` for the various input and output formats used in `MITgcm`. It implements the `ClimateModels.jl` interface, and opens up a whole new way of using `MITgcm` interactively from Jupyter and Pluto notebooks. `MITgcm.jl` in turn brings full-featured, reliable ocean modeling to Julia.

# Statement of Need

The cutting-edge of climate modeling, and much of its legacy, is based on numerical models written in compiled languages like `Fortran` or `C`. The MIT general circulation model (`MITgcm`) for example now runs globally at the kilometer scale to provide an unprecedented view of ocean dynamics (Fig.~\ref{fig:examples}, @camp-etal:04,  @marshall1997fvi, @Gallmeier2023). With its unrivaled adjoint modeling capabilities, `MITgcm` is also the computational engine that powers the ECCO ocean reanalysis, a widely-used data-assimilating product in climate science (Fig. \ref{fig:examples}, @heimbach2002automatic, @Forget2015a,  @Forget2024). `MITgcm` additionally provides unique modeling capabilities for ocean biogeochemistry, ecology, and optics (@Dutkiewicz2015, @Cbiomes2019). While a new generation of models, written in languages like C++ and Julia, is poised to better exploit GPUs (@OceananigansJOSS, @Wu2022, @e3sm-model), `Fortran`-based models are expected to remain popular on other computer architectures for the foreseable future. They also provide a crucial reference point to evaluate next generation models.

Models like `MITgcm` benefit from decades of accumulated expertise, careful inspection, and continuous integration. Running such a model or exploiting its results does not require knowing the computer language being used internally. However, `Fortran`-based models can sometime appear complicated or inconvenient to operate due to technical hurdles like having to use a compiler directly, to edit text files manually, or to deal with shell-scripting. Fortunately, such issues are easily alleviated by providing a user-friendly interface (e.g., Fig. \ref{fig:interact}) written in a high-level language (e.g., `Julia`) to interact with climate models written in lower-level languages as done here for `MITgcm`.

`MITgcm.jl` can read the various types of model output that `MITgcm` generates. This feature in itself enables common result analysis tasks like mapping and plotting, but also accurate computations of quantities such as ocean heat transport and global warming (Fig. \ref{fig:examples}, @Forget2015a, @Forget2019, @Forget2024). In addition, `MITgcm.jl` makes it easy to deploy and run any configuration of `MITgcm` on laptops, HPC clusters, and in the cloud. `MITgcm.jl` interacts with `MITgcm`'s run-time model parameters. These are represented in `Julia` as an ordered dictionary, and can be re-exported to the standard `TOML` file format, or to the native `MITgcm` format. Owing to this two-way interface, `MITgcm` can now be used from Jupyter or Pluto notebooks directly via `MITgcm.jl`. The package includes a series of examples and tutorials that demonstrate the interface (e.g., Fig. \ref{fig:interact}). 

In the code example below, `MITgcm_config` defines the `MC` data structure. The `run` command is equivalent to the `setup(MC); build(MC); launch(MC)` sequence. And `readdir` is used to list the content of the folder where the model ran (a temporary folder by default).

```
using MITgcm
MC=MITgcm_config(configuration="tutorial_held_suarez_cs")
run(MC)
readdir(MC,"run")
```

We can then modify parameters in julia, call `write_all_namelists` to update the `MITgcm` run-time parameter files accordingly, and rerun a new model simulation in the same folder. In the example below, we thus extend the simulation to 64 time steps. 

```
MC.inputs[:main][:PARM03][:nTimeSteps]=64
write_all_namelists(MC.inputs,joinpath(MC,"run"))
launch(MC)    
```

`MITgcm.jl` brings all of `MITgcm`'s modeling capabilities to a new category of users, who may not be trained in `Fortran` or shell-scripting. Furthermore, `MITgcm.jl` implements the `ClimateModels.jl` interface [@ClimateModels2024], which (1) streamlines the handling of file folders, (2) makes it easier to run and rerun simulations, and (3) supports an extensive lineup of complementary models written in various languages. `MITgcm.jl` can also be used to build integrated cyberinfrastructure solutions as demonstrated in  @Duckworth2023. 

`MITgcm.jl` in turn provides the vast `MITgcm` user community with a bridge to new tools for machine learning, artificial intelligence, differential equations, visualization, etc from the `Julia` software stack. Examples include the use of `MITgcm` output in offline mode to estimate sea water pathways and ocean transports (Fig. \ref{fig:examples}, @Forget2021), or simulate the behavior of marine ecosystems using an agent-based modeling approach [@Wu2022].
